## Where We Started

_People's moods differ throughout time_. Sometimes, we are affected by personal matters, social affairs, or the weather. Other times, more prominent aspects might affect our mood; we can be affected by the outcome of political elections, international disputes, or long-lasting pandemics. However, we constantly talk about our mood and its causes, and we might be affected by what we read in the media.

#### Our Motivation

Provided with the QuoteBank data set, we became interested in what it could reveal about the truth in the everyday talk about our mood. For example, does the temper become better towards the weekend, or do we all love Mondays deep inside? As the weather probably affects our mood, is the mood better during the summer and worse when the cold hits us in the winter? Moreover, as the data set consists of quotes from the media, what can we say about the trends of the mood in the media throughout time?

#### Why Is It Important?

Based on our initial questions, our thoughts wandered into what we could say specifically about the mood in the media. As the media sets the agenda for the public debate, it is interesting to see how much positivity and negativity reach the readers' minds. Which media outlets provide us with the most positivity, and which are more negative? Moreover, can we see any differences across the subsets of speakers in the data set? For example, are politicians more positive in their quotes than others? Do women tend to be more optimistic than their peers?

We aim to present our findings on the abovementioned topics in the upcoming data story. Starting with the [QuoteBank](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf) data set provided by **dlab @ EPFL**, we will utilize information from Wikidata to research our questions by sentiment analyses.

## What We Have

#### Quotebank

The Quotebank data set provides quotes in the media from more than a decade, having 178 million quotations from 2008 to 2020 attributed with their probable speakers and dates. Using machine learning methods, **dlab @ EPFL** has build a framework for recognizing and attributing quotations from media articles, thus building the data set. However, we have only utilized quotations from 2015 to 2020, distributed through the years as in the following diagram:

{% include_relative /_plots/line_dig.html %}

As you could see, there are some significant "holes" in the data set in 2016, having significantly less quotations than the majority of the period. We also see that the amount of quotations each day decreases towards the end of the data set in 2020. This is a finding that could be important for our future investigations. As well as quotations and their respective speakers, Quotebank attributes quotations with the media outlet in which it was first discovered, how many times it has occurred and how the algorithm recognized it as a quote. Eventually, the algorithm has attributed the quotations with links to the Wikidata entries of its probable speaker.

#### Wikidata

Well, that the quotations are attributed with links to the Wikidata entries mean that we could utilize information about the speakers in an effortless way. Wikidata is an open database associated with Wikipedia, and is meant to provide standardized types of information such that it can be used easily. We will primarily use Wikidata to identify the gender of the speakers, as well as whether they are politians or not.

## _Sentiments Analyses_ -- What Are They?

Sentiment analyses aim to identify and extract subjective information in text, telling whether a phrase is positive, negative, or neutral. Using libraries, one could input a sentence, such as a quote from the media, and get a score. This will be our primary tool in finding trends in the mood of the media.

</p>

##### _Compound Scores_ -- Huh?

In our analyses, we have utilized the _compound score_ of the quotes in Quotebank, generated by the _Vader Lexicon_ in the _NLTK_ library. The compound score is a measure of the total sentiment of a quote, indicating the sum of positive, negative and neutral scores of the words in a text, eventually normalized to be a value between $-1$ and $1$. A score of $-1$ indicates the most negative compound, while a score of $+1$ indicates the most positive.

<div>
    <blockquote> 
        Fear itself is always more dangerous than the thing you fear. The fear of death is worse than dying. Fear takes you hostage and kills your resistance. Nowhere is fear more fatal than in prison.
        <cite> Mehmet Altan </cite>
     </blockquote>
</div>

The above quotation has a compound score of $-0.9891$, indicating that it is quite negative, as you probably could predict when reading it.

<div>
    <blockquote> 
        I was glad to see him, and I'd like to think he was glad to see me.
        <cite> L. Kennedy </cite>
     </blockquote>
</div>

On the other hand, the above quotation receives a compound score of $0.8176$, which is reasonable as it contains some light, positive words. While these quotations show the extremes on the compound scale, the majority of quotations lie in the middle. For instance, the following quotation gets a score of $0.00$, and is therefore considered absolutely neutral:

<div>
    <blockquote> 
        There's a fact of life. The Assad regime has stabilized the situation in much of Syria.
        <cite> Eran Lerman </cite>
     </blockquote>
</div>

As you might have thought of, the art of dedicating compound scores to quotations is not perfect. Our tool, _Vader_, represents each document or text as a bag of words, without capturing the information in word proximity or context. Hence, a lot of the contextual information is lost. Moreover, _Vader_ gives additional weight to special words and phrases, for instance words written in uppercase or emojis. The methods are based on research done with actual humans, and are therefore not considered a machine learning method. On the other hand, the algorithm is likely not to discover the underlying context of a quotation, and could thus mark a quotation of positive, even if it is considering a deeply serious matter, such as we could see above.

##### _Subjectivity Scores_ -- Uhm?

To make our analyses richer, we will also utilize a measure of _subjectivity_. Here, we use the _TextBlob_ library to compute the subjectivity scores of the quotes in Quotebank, indicating whether a quote's content is subjective, objective or somewhere inbetween. A subjectivity score of $1.00$ indicate the most subjective quotes, while a score of $0.00$ indicate objectivity. Therefore, the subjectivity scores indicate the amount of personal opinions and factual information contained in a text, phrase or quote.

<div>
  <blockquote>
    Think of that. That crazy Nancy. She is crazy. And shifty Schiff. How about this guy? He makes up my conversation, which was perfect. He makes up my conversation. He sees what I said. It doesn't play well because it was perfect.
    <cite> Donald Trump </cite>
  </blockquote>
</div>

Let's consider subjectivity score of the above quote. As the speaker of the quote is Donald Trump, you might not be surprised that it receives a subjectivity score of $1.00$. Actually, a large amount of the quotes in Quotebank receives high subjectivity scores, simply because they are communicating the opinions of the speaker. On the other hand, the following quote receives a subjectivity score of $0.00$. This is reasonable as it, for most of us, represent an objective fact:

<div>
  <blockquote>
    Boris Johnson got 43 percent of the vote.
    <cite> David Lammy </cite>
  </blockquote>
</div>

As you might have guessed, computing subjectivity scores is not a precise science either. As _Vader_, _TextBlob_ consider texts as bags of words, meaning that it doesn't capture the entire context. Thus, _TextBlob_ links words to their probable subjectivity, and averages over the phrase. In addition, the tool looks at _intensity_, determining whether a word affect the next, e.g., adverbs like _very_. However, as the library doesn't capture the entire context and averages the subjectivity scores of words over a phrase, we migth discover some weird results. For instance, it is probably not reasonable, at least for most of us, that the following quote, receives a subjectivity score of $0.00$, indicating that it is objective:

<div>
  <blockquote>
    He's fallen asleep. He has no idea what the hell he's doing or saying.
    <cite> Donald Trump about Joe Biden </cite>
  </blockquote>
</div>

#### _The data_

#### _Mood across time -- Do we really love Mondays deep inside?_

As previously mentioned, we were curious about how the mood differs throughout time. More specifically, we wanted to test whether the temper changes across weekdays and seasons of the year. To determine the validness of our hypothesis, we utilize the previously mentioned sentiment analysis combined with statistical tests to identify the statistical significance.

**Statistical tests**

The statistical tests we will utilize are t-test and a variant named Welch's t-test. Shortly described, these tests test whether the mean of two groups is statistically significantly different. They will both be used for hypothesis testing, namely testing the null hypothesis:

__**H0:** The mean of group 1 equals the mean of group 2.__

From the results of a t-test, we can infer a p-value that tells us how statistically significant the results are. The p-value describes how likely it is, under the null hypothesis, to observe results as extreme or more extreme than the result we observed. In this data story, we will use a significance level of 1%, i.e., if the p-value is lower than 1%, we will reject the null hypothesis. This is only a short and simplified explanation of t-tests. For a more thorough description, see SOURCE.

**Score distribution over time**
{% include_relative /_plots/line_comp.html %}

The plot above shows the distribution of compound sentiment scores over time. The sentiment is mostly equal over time with slight variance, but the score is significantly lower in some periods. By comparing the plot to the distribution of quotes shown earlier, we see that these low sentiment periods correspond with periods with very few quotes. This is caused by high variance in periods with few quotes.


**Are we happier on Fridays, or do we really love Mondays deep inside?**

Firstly, we will investigate how the mood changes during the week.

{% include_relative /_plots/quotesperday.html %}

As expected, there are more quotes from weekdays than from the weekend.

{% include_relative /_plots/boxplot_day.html %}

We see that the sentiment scores across days are very similar by investigating the boxplot. The mean compound sentiment score for the different days are approximately equal. Disappointingly, this provides no evidence for the mood differing across weekdays.


**We are happier during summer than the rainy autumn, right?**
Disenchanted by the lack of differences across weekdays, we decided to study the differences across months.

{% include_relative /_plots/quotespermonth.html %}

There are some differences in the number of quotes per month in the dataset. These differences correspond to the previously mentioned periods with few quotes.


{% include_relative /_plots/boxplot_month.html %}

As for the weekday analysis, the month analysis shows minimal differences. Even though the medians for the months vary some, the interquartile range is approximately equal for all five months. We can, therefore, not conclude with any differences in mood based on months and seasons. 

**Covid-19 made us less happy, shocker right?**

As the illuminated reader may know, in March 2020, a certain pandemic hit the world. The Quotebank dataset provides a unique opportunity to assess how the mood in the media changed during this time. 

To assess the impact, we will study the media's mood differences in January and February 2020 (pre-Covid) vs. March and April 2020 (Covid). This is a simplification but adequate for our purposes.

In the plot at the start of this section, where we show the distribution of compound sentiment score over time, the mood drops drastically in March 2020.  There are also other sections of the plot where the mood drops drastically, but this is the only section where there is no significant drop in the number of quotes, and the mood stays down for a period. This points towards there being some substance in our hypothesis. Furthermore, we calculate the mean compound score for the two periods. In the pre-Covid period, the mean compound score is 0.19. However, in the Covid period, the mean compound score is 0.16. In other words, the compound score is 18.75% higher in the Covid period.

To determine whether the observed difference is significant, we utilize the previously mentioned t-test. The p-value is 0.000, which signifies that the result is very significant. We reject the null hypothesis that the mood in the pre-Covid period equals the mood in the post-Covid period. In other words, there is clear evidence for the Covid-19 pandemic to have impacted the mood in the media. 




##### _Media_
Another interesting hypothesis is that the mood differs between different media outlets. Do you read the Wall Street Journal or Peoples magazine together with your morning coffee if you want to set the mood for the rest of the day? 

It seems plausible that the sentiment and subjectivity in a daily newspaper will be different than a celebrity or sports magazine. To investigate this hypothesis, a subsample of media outlets from the quote bank is chosen. The subsample is based on a selection of the most well-known English newspapers and magazines from different categories. The quotes are then assigned with values for compound and subjectivity score.

Below is a scatterplot showing the connection between mean polarity and subjectivity score for the selected media outlets.  


{% include_relative /_plots/scatterplot_medias.html %}

Clearly, there is a difference!

First let us have a look at the two extremes: New York Times and Woman’s Day. The reputable New York Times receives an average compound score of 0.085, while Woman’s Day providing recipes and relationship advice, get a score of 0.235. For the subjectivity score the same outlets get a score of respectively 0.344 and 0.426. The differences are clear, and statistically very significant. Is this a general trend for newspapers and magazines? 

To examine this, we further assign the media outlets with four subcategories: subcategories Newspapers, Sports and celebrity magazines and “others”.   Below, the distribution of the compound scores for the four subcategories are drawn. The amount of positive quotes in sport and celebrity magazines (average compound score 0.27 and 0.17) clearly surpasses those from the newspapers (average compound 0.14).

To conclude it seems safe to assume that if you are one of those who are influenced by what you read: Put away your newspapers and start reading some gossip!

When concluding on mood through the week, we could use the following Google search: _Does the mood get better towards the weekend?_, as it gives some interesting researchs.

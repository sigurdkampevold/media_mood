## Where We Started

_People's moods differ throughout time_. Sometimes, we are affected by personal matters, social affairs, or the weather. Other times, more prominent aspects might affect our mood; we can be affected by the outcome of political elections, international disputes, or long-lasting pandemics. However, we constantly talk about our mood and its causes, and we might be affected by what we read in the media.

#### Our Motivation

Provided with the QuoteBank data set, we became interested in what it could reveal about the truth in the everyday talk about our mood. For example, does the temper become better towards the weekend, or do we all love Mondays deep inside? As the weather probably affects our mood, is the mood better during the summer and worse when the cold hits us in the winter? Moreover, as the data set consists of quotes from the media, what can we say about the trends of the mood in the media throughout time?

#### Why Is It Important?

Based on our initial questions, our thoughts wandered into what we could say specifically about the mood in the media. As the media sets the agenda for the public debate, it is interesting to see how much positivity and negativity reach the readers' minds. Which media outlets provide us with the most positivity, and which are more negative? Moreover, can we see any differences across the subsets of speakers in the data set? For example, are politicians more positive in their quotes than others? Do women tend to be more optimistic than their peers?

We aim to present our findings on the abovementioned topics in the upcoming data story. Starting with the [QuoteBank](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf) data set provided by **dlab @ EPFL**, we will utilize information from Wikidata to research our questions by sentiment analyses.

## What We Have

Initially, we want to give a feel about what data we have to work with, and give some initial analyses and comments on the methods we will use in our work.

### Quotebank

The Quotebank data set provides quotes in the media from more than a decade, having 178 million quotations from 2008 to 2020 attributed with their probable speakers and dates. Using machine learning methods, **dlab @ EPFL** has build a framework for recognizing and attributing quotations from media articles, thus building the data set. However, we have only utilized quotations from 2015 to 2020, distributed through the years as in the following diagram:

{% include_relative /_plots/line_dig.html %}

As you could see, there are some significant "holes" in the data set in 2016, having significantly less quotations than the majority of the period. We also see that the amount of quotations each day decreases towards the end of the data set in 2020. This is a finding that could be important for our future investigations. As well as quotations and their respective speakers, Quotebank attributes quotations with the media outlet in which it was first discovered, how many times it has occurred and how the algorithm recognized it as a quote. Eventually, the algorithm has attributed the quotations with links to the Wikidata entries of its probable speaker.

### Wikidata

Well, that the quotations are attributed with links to the Wikidata entries mean that we could utilize information about the speakers in an effortless way. Wikidata is an open database associated with Wikipedia, and is meant to provide standardized types of information such that it can be used easily. We will primarily use Wikidata to identify the gender of the speakers, as well as whether they are politians or not.

### _Sentiments Analyses_ -- What Are They?

Sentiment analyses aim to identify and extract subjective information in text, telling whether a phrase is positive, negative, or neutral. Using libraries, one could input a sentence, such as a quote from the media, and get a score. This will be our primary tool in finding trends in the mood of the media.

</p>

##### _Compound Scores_ -- Huh?

In our analyses, we have utilized the _compound score_ of the quotes in Quotebank, generated by the _Vader Lexicon_ in the _NLTK_ library. The compound score is a measure of the total sentiment of a quote, indicating the sum of positive, negative and neutral scores of the words in a text, eventually normalized to be a value between $-1$ and $1$. A score of $-1$ indicates the most negative compound, while a score of $+1$ indicates the most positive.

<div>
    <blockquote>
        Fear itself is always more dangerous than the thing you fear. The fear of death is worse than dying. Fear takes you hostage and kills your resistance. Nowhere is fear more fatal than in prison.
        <cite> Mehmet Altan </cite>
     </blockquote>
</div>

The above quotation has a compound score of $-0.9891$, indicating that it is quite negative, as you probably could predict when reading it.

<div>
    <blockquote>
        I was glad to see him, and I'd like to think he was glad to see me.
        <cite> L. Kennedy </cite>
     </blockquote>
</div>

On the other hand, the above quotation receives a compound score of $0.8176$, which is reasonable as it contains some light, positive words. While these quotations show the extremes on the compound scale, the majority of quotations lie in the middle. For instance, the following quotation gets a score of $0.00$, and is therefore considered absolutely neutral:

<div>
    <blockquote>
        There's a fact of life. The Assad regime has stabilized the situation in much of Syria.
        <cite> Eran Lerman </cite>
     </blockquote>
</div>

As you might have thought of, the art of dedicating compound scores to quotations is not perfect. Our tool, _Vader_, represents each document or text as a bag of words, without capturing the information in word proximity or context. Hence, a lot of the contextual information is lost. Moreover, _Vader_ gives additional weight to special words and phrases, for instance words written in uppercase or emojis. The methods are based on research done with actual humans, and are therefore not considered a machine learning method. On the other hand, the algorithm is likely not to discover the underlying context of a quotation, and could thus mark a quotation of positive, even if it is considering a deeply serious matter, such as we could see above.

##### _Subjectivity Scores_ -- Uhm?

To make our analyses richer, we will also utilize a measure of _subjectivity_. Here, we use the _TextBlob_ library to compute the subjectivity scores of the quotes in Quotebank, indicating whether a quote's content is subjective, objective or somewhere inbetween. A subjectivity score of $1.00$ indicate the most subjective quotes, while a score of $0.00$ indicate objectivity. Therefore, the subjectivity scores indicate the amount of personal opinions and factual information contained in a text, phrase or quote.

<div>
  <blockquote>
    Think of that. That crazy Nancy. She is crazy. And shifty Schiff. How about this guy? He makes up my conversation, which was perfect. He makes up my conversation. He sees what I said. It doesn't play well because it was perfect.
    <cite> Donald Trump </cite>
  </blockquote>
</div>

Let's consider the subjectivity score of the above quote. As the speaker of the quote is Donald Trump, you might not be surprised that it receives a subjectivity score of $1.00$. Actually, a large amount of the quotes in Quotebank receives high subjectivity scores, simply because they are communicating the opinions of the speaker. On the other hand, the following quote receives a subjectivity score of $0.00$. This is reasonable as it, for most of us, represent an objective fact:

<div>
  <blockquote>
    Boris Johnson got 43 percent of the vote.
    <cite> David Lammy </cite>
  </blockquote>
</div>

As you might have guessed, computing subjectivity scores is not a precise science either. As _Vader_, _TextBlob_ consider texts as bags of words, meaning that it doesn't capture the entire context. Thus, _TextBlob_ links words to their probable subjectivity, and averages over the phrase. In addition, the tool looks at _intensity_, determining whether a word affect the next, e.g., adverbs like _very_. However, as the library doesn't capture the entire context and averages the subjectivity scores of words over a phrase, we migth discover some weird results. For instance, it is probably not reasonable, at least for most of us, that the following quote, receives a subjectivity score of $0.00$, indicating that it is objective:

<div>
  <blockquote>
    He's fallen asleep. He has no idea what the hell he's doing or saying.
    <cite> Donald Trump about Joe Biden </cite>
  </blockquote>
</div>

### The Initial Investigations

So, after looking at some examples of quotes and their respective compound and subjectivity scores, you might wonder how these scores are distributed within the part of Quotebank we are working with. Firstly, we could take a look at how the compound scores are distributed:

{% include_relative /_plots/comp_dist.html %}

Not surprising, the distribution is heavily centered around at a compound score of $0.0$. As the compound score of _Vader_ is computed through averaging, this seems reasonable. However, we do see that the distribution seems to be more heavy on the positive values, maybe indicating that the quotations in the media are more positive than negative, although neutrality sweeps the board.

{% include_relative /_plots/sub_dist.html %}

Over to the subjectivity, a score of $0.0$ is once again the most frequent one. This could maybe be more surprising, as quotations and citations often refer to the opinions of the speaker. However, it seems like _TextBlob_'s methods overwhelmingly often end up with a score of $0.0$. Initially, one might think that as _TextBlob_ doesn't capture the underlying context, it doesn't extract the subjectivity neither. Eventually, we do also mind that the remaining distribution is centered around $0.5$, but also having a clear upswing towards $1.0$.

## What We Have Found

### Does the Mood in the Media Evolve Throughout Time?

People do talk about their mood swings. The topic is a part of the everyday talk, and we want to investigate if such _everydays myths_ are present in the quotations of the media as well. To concretize our work, we decided to investigate whether the mood evolves during the week and across the seasons of the year.

But first, we have to zoom out. How should we even be able to draw any conclusions from our data set and analyses, only by doing utilizing libraries for sentiment analysis and making visualizations? Luckily, we have a solution.

##### Statistical Tests

To say whether our results are valid, we will utilize statistical tests. More precisely, we will use classical _t-tests_ and an variant named _Welch's t-test_. In short, these methods test whether the mean of two groups is statistically significantly different. Both kind of tests will be used for hypothesis testing, where we will check whether the following null hypothesis is valid:

_The mean of group one equals the mean of group two._

Using the abovementioned methods, we will end up having a _p-value_. This value tells us how statistically significant our results are. Or, in other words, the p-value tells us how likely it is, given that the null hypothesis is true, to observe results as extreme, or even more extreme, than what we have observed.

For our work, we will use a significance level of $1\%$. This implies that if the p-value given by the methods is lower than $1\%$, we will conclude that the means of the two groups are different, given the significance level. Thus, we will say that the results are statistically significant.

As this data story is not about statistical tricks and treat, we will leave the subject for now. If you would like a deeper a explanation of our methods, you could take a look at our [notebook](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2021-project-gutta-boys). However, to sum up, we will test whether the means of two groups are equal: If our results are too unlikely to happen with equal means, we will conclude that our results are significant. Puh, that was the boring stuff, now, let us zoom in again!

##### How Does the Compound Score Evolve?

As we will use the _compound score_ of _Vader_ to measure the mood in the media, we head off by looking at it is evolving througout the data set. We start by finding the average compound score of each date, resulting in the following plot:

{% include_relative /_plots/line_comp.html %}

Looking at the vertical axis, we see that the compound scores are mostly around $0.12$ with some slight variances. However, there are some major deviations for the compound scores in 2016. The Argus-eyed reader may remember that the data set contains less quotations from the same period as the deviations, with only some hundreds of quotations a day. Therefore, it is likely that the deviations results from a lower amount of quotations, giving higher variance.

##### _The Weekend Effect_

Indeed a part of everyday talk, people believe that their mood get better in the weekend, and also towards the weekend. _The soon weekend-feeling_, _the friday-feeling_ and so on, people love the feeling of more autonomony, better sleep and a desired freedom from the stressfull everyday life. Actually, [researchers](https://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=3525) have found the mood to be better in the end of the week. Therefore, we became interested in whether the quotations of the media reflect this as well.

To get further understanding of the topic, we head off by looking at the number of media quotations each weekday:

{% include_relative /_plots/quotesperday.html %}

As expected, there are more quotations originating from weekdays than from the weekend. The journalists enjoy the weekend as well.

{% include_relative /_plots/boxplot_day.html %}

Investigating the boxplot, we see that the compound scores across the weeks are very similar. The mean scores for the different days are approixmately equal, once again varying around $0.2$. Actually, the median compound is highest for Thursdays, Mondays and Sundays. However, the results are too similar to find any statistically differences in the mood across weekdays.

[comment]: # "How does the mean vary from the median in the above boxplot?"

##### _The Season Effect_

Disenchanted by the lack of differences across weekdays, we move on towards the next everyday myth. That the weather affects the mood is indeed a belief in the society. When the sun is shining, we are hurrying outside, exploring the world and enjoying life. On the other hand, rainy days call for dark times, slight depression and frustration. So again, do the media represent the same deviations in the mood? To easen our analyses, we decide to rather search for differences across the months and seasons of the year, assuming that the weather is better during summer.

To head off, we once again look at the distribution of quotations throughout the year:

{% include_relative /_plots/quotespermonth.html %}

There are some differences in the number of quotations per month in the our data set. These differences correspond to the previously mentioned periods with few quotes.

{% include_relative /_plots/boxplot_month.html %}

As for the compound scores of the different weekdays, the analysis on the months shows minimal differences. As for the weekday analysis, the month analysis shows minimal differences. Even though the medians vary some around $0.12$, the interquartile range, indicating where half of the data is placed, is approximately equal fo all twelve months. It is once again not possible to conclude on any differences in the mood of the quotations across months and seasons, maybe implying that the weather does not affect our mood as much as we believed. Actually, further [investigations](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2021/jul/can-weather-affect-your-mood/) shows that researchers also have found the evidence for such an hypothesis to be murky. Unluckily, there are not evidence for our first hypothesis, but during the work, the visualizations turned out as a blessing in disguise.

##### _The COVID-19 Effect_

Hitting of the analyses on how the mood evolves throughout time, we illustrated how the compound score develops through our data set. For simplicity, the visualization follows once again:

{% include_relative /_plots/line_comp.html %}
[comment]: # This doesn't render

The compound score above drops drastically in March 2020. There are other sections of the plot where the compound drops drastically, but this in the only section havving no significant drop in the amount of quotations. Moreover, the mood stays down for some time, actually until the end of the data set.

As an illuminated reader, you have surely drawn the lines already. A certain pandemic hit the western world in March 2020, resulting in lockdowns, fright and economic cracks. The mood in the population indeed fell in this period, and the diagram points out that the same yielded in the media. The Quotebank dataset provides a unique opportunity to assess how the mood in the media changed during the first lockdowns, and we decide to dive further into the topic.

To assess the changes in the mood, we will study the compound score in the media in January and February 2020, and call this the pre-COVID score. This score will be compared to the score in the March and April 2020, namely the COVID score. Indeed, this is a simplification, but it is adequate for our purpose.

The mean compound score of pre-COVID is $0.19$, versus the mean compound score of COVID at $0.16$. In other words, the compound score was %18.75$ higher pre-COVID. Thus, the mood in the media was better before lockdowns.

To conclude on whether the observed difference is significant, we utilize the previously mentioned _t-test_, resulting in a p-value of $0.0$, signifying that the result is very significant. We could therefore conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the mood in the media, and that it got worse.

### How Does the Mood Differ Across Media Outlets?

We can say that the mood of the quotations in the media doesn't vary too much across, unless a global pandemic hits us. However, as the media eventually decides what reaches the public debate and your mind, it could be interesting to explore how the mood differs across the media. Which newspapers are more positive, and which are more negative? If you want to kick-off the day with a good mood, should you read Wall Street Journal or Peoples Magazine?

Initially, it is reasonable to believe that the compound and subjectivity score of daily newspaper is different from that of a celebrity magazine. But does the Quotebank data set provide evidence for such a hypothesis? To investigate this, we choose to focus on a subsample of the media outlets represented in Quotebank. The subsample is a selection of the most well-known English-writing newspapers and magazines aiming to represent different categories. As earlier, we use _Vader_ and _TextBlob_ to compute the compound score and subjectivity score of each quotes, eventually grouped by media outlet and outlet category.

Starting the analyses, we plot the average compound score against the average subjectivity score for the selected media outlets:

{% include_relative /_plots/scatterplot_medias.html %}

Clearly, there is a difference! Even though all the outlets are situated within a relative tiny part of the area, there seems significant variance in the two sores. Let's consider two of the extremes: New York Times and Woman's Day. The reputable New York Times, a daily newspaper, has an average compound score of $0.085$, while the celebrity magazine Woman's Day, providing recipes and relationship advices, receives a score of $0.235$ - nearly three times as high. On the other hand, the subjectivity scores of the outlets are $0.344$ and $0.426$ respectively. The differences are clear, and statistically significant by our methods. Is this an example of a general trend for newspapers and magazines?

For further investigations, we assign each media outlet to one of four different subcategories: Newspapers, sports newspapers, celebrity magazines and "others". Averaging the scores within each subcategory, we get the following distributions:

{% include_relative /_plots/polarity_distribution_categories_same_plot.html %}

[comment]: # "Need to have x-axis!"

The differences are significant. The amount of positive quotations in sports newspapers and celebrity magazines clearly surpasses the amount in the daily newspapers, having average compound scores of $0.27$ and $0.17$ versus $0.14$ respectively. This might be reasonable, as daily newspaper should cover all the suffering in the society, while sports newspapers might focus on victorious athletes.

However, it seems safe to conclude that if you are getting influenced by what you read in the media: Put away your newspapers and start reading some gossip!

##### _Gender_

TODO: Få inn nøkkeltall og compound distribution histogram, evt også noe bonus

Do the represented genders in the dataset differ in their sentiments?

Results show that there is a significant difference in the sentiment of males and females.

{% include_relative /_plots/marcus/line_compound_males_females_month.html %}

On average women had a slightly, but significant, higher sentiment score than males. The shown graph also showcases that the graph for females vary more, but this is attributed to there being fewer quotations from women (ca. 1/8).

##### _Politicians_

TODO: Få inn nøkkeltall og evt finn annen plot til dataene, evt også en enkelt-politiker

Do politicians really represent the average person?

Shown below we see the significant difference between politicians and everyone's sentiment over time.
